{/* /** Animals ## Do
1. FIRST, create the UI with following elements: 
    - <div> to display the Animal's type (type), number of journeys (journeysNo), and information about the animal being (or not) in the Forest (isHere) 
    - <form> with one input field (Animal's type) and one button (save Animal type)
    - <button> that says either Go on a Journey or Return from the Journey (depends on isHere)
1. THEN, write the application's logic:
    - when the user clicks the form's button, update the Animal's type
    - when the user clicks the journey button, toggle isHere and increment journeysNo by 1 **/ * /}
